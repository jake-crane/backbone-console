This is a backbone POC project to replace the AWD configuration console.

run npm install to download dependencies.
run npm start to start application.

Things this does better than the old console:
* Users can search for a configuration.
    * Ctrl-F can use used to get focus of the search.
    * The search can match any part of a configuration.
* Everything is faster.
* The entire page doesn't re-load for each change.
* Configurations can be deleted.
